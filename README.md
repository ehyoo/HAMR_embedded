# HAMR Embedded  
----  
MODLAB, CRI Project
----
Refactored and updated version of the [original HAMR implementation](https://github.com/wangchr/HAMR)

## Instructions
Be sure to have all libraries downloaded (they can be found online) and copied to the Arduino library directory (usually ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries).

Otherwise, simply upload to the Arduino, connecti to the access point (hamr_net), and use the provided Python libraries to control the HAMR!
